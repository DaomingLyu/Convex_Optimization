Bisection search algorithm to get familiar with ways to implement the oracle access.

Bisection. Implementation of the bisection method in algorithms.py. See your notes for the implementation.

Backtracking line search. Implementation of the backtracking line search in algorithms.py. This is algorithm 9.2 of Boyd and Vandenberghe.

 The implementations of gradient descent and Newtons method in algorithms.py. Gradient descent is algorithm 9.3 of Boyd and Vanden- berghe, and Newtons method is algorithm 9.5.
